# Final Integration Steps

Follow these steps to complete the integration of the modular framework into the Xcode project:

## 1. Set Execute Permissions

First, we need to make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x make_scripts_executable.sh
./make_scripts_executable.sh
```

## 2. Run Integration

Next, run the integration command:

```bash
./integrate.command
```

This will:
- Organize all module files into the appropriate directory structure
- Update the Xcode project configuration
- Set up module dependencies

## 3. Open in Xcode

Open the project in Xcode:

```bash
open MiddlewareConnect.xcodeproj
```

## 4. Build the Project

In Xcode:
1. Select "Product" > "Build" or press ⌘+B
2. If there are any build errors, check the console output for details

## 5. Running Tests

To run the unit tests:
1. Select the "LLMServiceProviderTests" scheme from the scheme selector
2. Press ⌘+U to run the tests

## 6. Next Steps

Now that the modules are integrated:
1. Review the MIGRATION_GUIDE.md file for guidance on using the new modules
2. Explore each module's interface through its main export file (e.g., LLMServiceProvider.swift)
3. Begin migrating existing code to use the modular architecture

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Check that all files have been properly copied to their destination directories
- Verify that the Xcode project file has been properly updated
- If necessary, restore from the backup project file created during integration
- Review the console output for any error messages

For more detailed information, refer to MODULE_INTEGRATION.md and MIGRATION_GUIDE.md.
