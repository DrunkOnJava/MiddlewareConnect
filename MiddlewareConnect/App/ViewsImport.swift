// These declarations will be matched to their implementations during compile time

/// ConversationsView forward declaration

    var body: some View {
        Text("ConversationsView Implementation")
    }
}

/// ToolsView forward declaration
struct ToolsView: View {

/// AnalysisView forward declaration

/// SettingsView forward declaration

// Note: The actual implementations of these views exist in their respective files
// in the Views directory. These forward declarations exist only to resolve 
// scope issues in MiddlewareConnectApp.swift.
