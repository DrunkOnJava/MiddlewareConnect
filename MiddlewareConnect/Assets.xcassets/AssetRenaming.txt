IMPORTANT: The following color assets must be renamed:
- PrimaryColor => AppPrimaryColor
- SecondaryColor => AppSecondaryColor

The original asset files have been deleted and replaced with new ones 
with the "App" prefix to avoid conflicts with SwiftUI's built-in colors.

These changes should be applied in the Xcode asset catalog.
